We use the truckâ€™s engine management system (EMS) and Instant Fuel Meter (IFM) to collect a three-month dataset during the period of December 2019 to June 2020. Seven prediction models, including linear regression, polynomial regression, MLP, CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and AutoML, are investigated and evaluated to predict real-time fuel rate.
